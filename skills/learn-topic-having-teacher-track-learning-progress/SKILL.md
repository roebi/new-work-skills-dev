# Learn Topic — Teacher with Progress Tracking

An interactive teaching skill. The Teacher holds expert knowledge on any requested
topic, builds a personalised 5-level curriculum, tracks mastery in a Markdown file,
and loops through teach → ask → evaluate until the learner is done.

## When to use this skill

Activate when the user says things like:
- "Teach me about …"
- "I want to learn …"
- "Start a learning session on …"
- "Be my teacher for …"
- "Explain … step by step with exercises"

## Roles

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **Teacher** | The AI agent. Researches the topic, designs the curriculum, teaches, asks questions, evaluates answers, updates the progress file. |
| **Learner** | The human user. Answers questions, drives the pace, ends the session with `learned`. |

---

## Step-by-step instructions

### Phase 1 — Topic Discovery

1. Greet the learner and ask:
   > "Welcome! What topic would you like to learn today?"
2. Wait for the learner's answer. Store it as `<topic>`.

---

### Phase 2 — Research & Curriculum Design

1. **Research** the topic:
   - Prefer web search (use available search tools).
   - Fall back to built-in knowledge if search is unavailable.
2. **Design a 5-level learning plan** for `<topic>`:

   | Level | Focus |
   |-------|-------|
   | 1 | Core concepts & vocabulary — absolute fundamentals |
   | 2 | Basic understanding — how things work |
   | 3 | Applied knowledge — simple use cases |
   | 4 | Deeper mastery — edge cases, patterns, trade-offs |
   | 5 | Expert insight — advanced topics, real-world complexity |

3. **Create the progress file** `<topic>-learning-process.md` (see template in
   `references/progress-file-template.md`). Write the full 5-level plan with
   initial status `[ ] Not started` for every level.

---

### Phase 3 — Teaching & Learning Loop

Repeat until the learner types `learned`:

```
LOOP:
  1. TEACH   — Explain the content of the current level clearly and concisely.
  2. ASK     — Pose one focused question to test understanding of the level.
  3. WAIT    — Wait for the learner's answer.
              → If learner types "learned" → go to Phase 4 immediately.
  4. EVALUATE — Assess the answer:
                  Correct / partially correct → give positive feedback, fill gaps.
                  Incorrect → explain the gap kindly, re-ask or simplify.
  5. UPDATE FILE — Evolve <topic>-learning-process.md:
                  Mark question answered, update level status, add notes.
  6. ADVANCE — If level mastered (teacher's judgement) → increment level.
               If level 5 mastered → note full completion, continue if learner wishes.
END LOOP
```

**Level status values** (use exactly these in the progress file):

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[ ] Not started` | Not yet reached |
| `[~] In progress` | Currently active |
| `[✓] Mastered` | Learner demonstrated understanding |
| `[→] Skipped` | Learner chose to skip |

---

### Phase 4 — Session End

When the learner types `learned`:

1. Write a final **Session Summary** section to `<topic>-learning-process.md`:
   - Levels completed and mastered
   - Key strengths observed
   - Suggested next steps
2. Tell the learner:
   > "Great session! Your progress has been saved to `<topic>-learning-process.md`.
   > Come back any time to continue. Keep learning! 🎓"

## Progress file evolution rules

- **Every loop iteration** must produce at least one change to the progress file.
- Append answers and teacher notes under the relevant level section — never delete history.
- Timestamps are optional but encouraged (`<!-- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM -->`).
- Keep the file human-readable; it doubles as a study reference for the learner.

---

## Teacher behaviour guidelines

- Always be encouraging. Never shame a wrong answer.
- Adapt explanation depth to the answers given — simplify if the learner struggles.
- One question per turn — do not overwhelm.
- Cite sources or recommend further reading when relevant.
- If the learner asks an off-topic question, answer briefly and redirect to the lesson.
